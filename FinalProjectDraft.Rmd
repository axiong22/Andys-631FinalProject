# Introduction

## Final Project Draft

## What?

We are going to look at multiple NFL Passing Data set from the year 2010-2018. They are all seperate data sets.

## Why?

I want to see if we see the trend for passing yards go up over time and see if their were any specific person responsible. I also wanted to try and combine multiple data sets into one on R Studio.

## How?

I want to explore the data using R functions we learned in class. I also want to attempt regression somehow. 

#Body

This is how I loaded the data sets into R using read.csv

```{r}
NFLSeason10 <- read.csv('C:/Users/hmoob/Documents\\pass-2010.csv')
NFLSeason11 <- read.csv('C:/Users/hmoob/Documents\\pass-2011.csv')
NFLSeason12 <- read.csv('C:/Users/hmoob/Documents\\pass-2012.csv')
NFLSeason13 <- read.csv('C:/Users/hmoob/Documents\\pass-2013.csv')
NFLSeason14 <- read.csv('C:/Users/hmoob/Documents\\pass-2014.csv')
NFLSeason15 <- read.csv('C:/Users/hmoob/Documents\\pass-2015.csv')
NFLSeason16 <- read.csv('C:/Users/hmoob/Documents\\pass-2016.csv')
NFLSeason17 <- read.csv('C:/Users/hmoob/Documents\\pass-2017.csv')
NFLSeason18 <- read.csv('C:/Users/hmoob/Documents\\pass-2018.csv')
```
